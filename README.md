# distance-sensor-pico-py
Project based on microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico and ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04. Distance between object and sensor is translated to diode lighting frequency.
Project support connection for simple numeric pad which allow to define working modes.
Note, circuit and program implementation released for computer engineering class assignment
